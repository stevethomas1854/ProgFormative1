			<p id="maintext"> There are many ways in which Computer Science has greatly benefitted the world of Engineering.</p>
			<br>
			<p id="maintext"> <br>Firstly, the calculations that were previously done by hand can be effortlessly calculated by the computer. Even for simple engineering tasks, having a computer has become essential. CPUs have been built to process billions of instructions per second. The same maths attempted by a human would take several days. Calculations such as calculating distances between places using Pytahgorean principles or calculating density of materials that are needed for building can be quickly formulated into a programme and can be run within a matter of seconds. This has greatly sped up the timescale of projects and has also led to more ambitious projects. </p>
			<br>
			<p id="maintext"> Secondly, planning of engineering has never been easier and its all thanks to computers. There are a multitude of options ranging from MATLAB to Google Sketchup and many more. These pieces of software can help plan out almost any engineering task so that they can be edited and manipulated with ease. Previously, doing this with pen and paper would have been laborious. More information about the mentioned software can be found below:</p>

			</center>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p id="maintext"> Thirdly, additional software has allowed the logistical side of engineering to be as easy as possible. There are many pieces of software designed to keep track of resources and the availability of them. They can also help plan the transportation and storage of materials as well. Furthermore, the digiitilisation of this information has also allowed companies to become international as operations can be controlled from anywhere around the world. This has allowed for international colloboration which has consequently led to more ambitious and impressive projects.</p>
			<br>
			<p id="maintext"> Finally, the impressive speed that computers can process information has allowed complex simualtions to be run. These are vital for engineers to check how effective a new system would be, or even if it would work at all. This means that engineers can quickly spot errors and improvements before any commitment has been made. This has saved not only money and resources but valuable time that can now be reinvested in creating a better system.</p>
