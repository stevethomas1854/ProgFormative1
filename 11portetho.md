i.Interest of content
The content covers a good couple of areas of computing. There is a link to a cyber security page but the page doesn't seem to exist.
Good

ii.Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Most of the images don't seem to work and when they do they're just inserted under the relevant paragraph. Very basic color scheme, just black & white. Could add some design elements /format the menu bar on the left. 
Clear presentation of information throughout still. Good use of links to outside sources to provide further reading. 
Sound


iii.Quality of written presentation
Content appears to be original and relatively interesting to read. Some pages have a lot less detail than others, like medicine. Some pages also seem to not exist. Good

iv.Validity of HTML
AAALLLLLrighty, Loads of unclosed tags and repeated ids which remove the purpose of ids. also a few empty links.
You should try segmenting your code and doing it one bit at a time, and not copy and paste within a single page doesn't matter between pages. Kind of acceptable

v.Evidence of collaboration including
Pages are authored, and linkedin profiles have been... linked in.
Good
